# HoloCure Autofisher
Simple Python script for automating the HoloCure fishing minigame.

- Made with a `1920x1080` resolution window in mind.
- Uses `WASD` for control input instead of `ARROW` keys.

Usage:

1. Set up `venv` with libs in `requirements.txt`.
2. Run `holofisher.py` in cmd.
3. Start fishing.
4. `Esc` from minigame then `Ctrl+C` in cmd to terminate.
